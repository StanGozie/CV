     <!--in order to create a layout where the image is right at the top of the webpage 
    and a brief bio  located right beside the image, the table format
is used to achieve that. like above, I began the webpage in a tabular format right after
my opening <body> tag. this is purely html. the cellspacing attribute inside the <table> 
    tag only serves to create some space between the image and the brief bio to avoid clutter.
    the border attribute inside the <table> tag also serves to give som structure to the table, a form of aesthetics. 
    there is a better way to go about this using css.  I removed the border though.-->
